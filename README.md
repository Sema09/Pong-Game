# Pong-Game

**The aim of the game is to keep the balls moving above the paddle at all times and to explode all the bubbles. 
Balls can be kept in the game using the paddle, by moving paddle left and right to avoid losing balls to the ground.

**When the “s” key is pressed, balls start moving. They move randomly to the right or left at a 45
degree angle. When the “k” key is pressed, all the balls get slower. When the “l” key is pressed,
the balls get faster.When “a” key is pressed, the paddle moves to
left, “d” key is pressed, it moves to right. Minimum and maximum speed limits were determined for the balls and
provided to you in the template code.

**If a ball hits to the boundaries of the window, i.e. left, right, upper bounds, or to the paddle; it will
bounce off and keep on its movement. When a ball hits the ground, you lose a life (check 8 for
additional details). When a ball hits the bubble, the corresponding bubble should be exploded and
the ball continues motion uninfluenced, until it hits the top of the window.

**When the game is over, pressing any key closes the window.
